# Image Dithering

Image Dithering is a Python package that provides a simple implementation of four popular dithering algorithms, Threshold, Error diffusion (Floyd-Stienberg), Ordered and Pattern (Halftone) Dithering techniques. Dithering is a technique used in image processing to reduce the number of colors in an image while still maintaining the visual appearance of the original image. The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy and Pillow libraries.

## Installation

To install Image Dithering, simply clone this repository to your desktop. It's recommended to use PyCharm IDE.


## Usage

Here's an example of how to use Image Dithering to convert an image to a 2-bit color palette using the threshold algorithm. Where `input.jpg` is the provided image as an input, `output_threshold.jpg` is the name of the output image generated by the algorithm, and `128` is the threshold value:

```
threshold_dithering('input.jpg', 'output_threshold.jpg', 128)
```

## Examples

Here is an example of an image before and after dithering:  ![Original Image](examples/lena.png)  ![Dithered Image (16 colors)](examples/lena_16.png)  ![Dithered Image (8 colors)](examples/lena_8.png)
